# Knowledge-Base-Systems

## Programming Project
In this project we had to construct a Semantic Base Knowledge regarding the mass transit. <br/>
Firstly, we had to create an ontology which describes the world of mass transit and extracts extra information creating meta-data after understanding the dataset of the given world. The ontology was created using the program Protege. <br/> 
Then, we had to collect the necessary data for the public transit means of Athens, such as underground buses etc, and transform these data into RDF triples applicable to the ontology. The transformation was implemented using Python3
Then this system was uploaded and saved in Virtuoso, a free software able to process these data. <br/>
Finally, we composed 10 different SPARQL queries in order to show how the system works. Some of these queries were really useful for an everyday application including Manhattan distances from different stations etc. <br/>
