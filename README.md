# Knowledge-Base-Systems

## Programming Project
In this project I had to construct a Semantic Base Knowledge regarding the mass transit(public transportation). <br/>
Firstly, I created an ontology which described the world of mass transit and extracted extra information creating meta-data after understanding the dataset of the given world. The ontology was created using the program Protege. <br/> 
Then, I collected the necessary data for the public transit means of Athens, such as underground buses etc, and transformed these data into RDF triples applicable to the ontology. The transformation was implemented using Python3.<br/>
Then this system was uploaded and saved in Virtuoso, a free software able to process these data. <br/>
Finally, I composed 10 different SPARQL queries in order to show how the system works. Some of these queries were really useful for an everyday application including Manhattan distances from different stations etc. <br/>
